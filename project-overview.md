# Cyclistic Bike-Share Data Analysis Project Overview

**Data Analyst:** Oscar Macho

**Client:** Cyclistic Bike-Share Company

## Purpose
Bike-sharing programs have gained significant popularity in recent years due to their potential to offer an affordable, environmentally-friendly, and convenient transportation option for urban commuters. However, with this rapid growth comes the challenge of navigating speedy success and ensuring sustainable growth.

The goal of this project is to maximize the number of annual memberships. The project will identify how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. After identifying the differences, the project will outline the major findings and recommendations based on the analysis.. Each recommendation must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations. The final deliverable will recommend the 3 most effective recommendations for growing the number of annual memberships.
